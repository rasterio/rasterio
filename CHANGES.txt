----

Breaking changes:

- In the GeoJSON output of rio-blocks, the windows are now JSON
  representations of the ``Window`` class (#1074).
- The ``rasterio.windows.Window`` class no longer derives from ``tuple``.
  Comparisons like ``Window(0, 0, 1, 1) == ((0, 1), (0, 1))`` are no
  longer possible. Instead, call the ``.toranges()`` method of the 
  former or coerce the latter using ``Window.from_ranges()`` (#1074).
- The ``rasterio.windows.from_bounds()`` function now always returns unbounded,
  meaning uncropped, Windows. For example, if given a bounding box entirely
  to the west and north of the geotransform's origin, the result will be a 
  Window entirely to the left and above the dataset's row and column origin.
  Passing a ``boundless`` keyword argument to this function will result in a 
  warning.

New features:

- Float precision read/write windows are now supported throughout
  Rasterio (#1074).
- Use of old style range tuples as windows is deprecated and warned
  against (#1074).


1.0a9 (2017-06-02)
------------------

Breaking changes:

- Removed `**options` argument from `rasterio.warp.transform()`.  Transformer
  options should be set explicitly inside the currently active
  `rasterio.env.Env()`(#1010).  This argument was initially added in `1.0a1`.
- The function `transform_geom()` now always splits geometries at the anti-
  meridian (#1024).
- The `crs` property of a dataset is now `None` instead of `CRS()` when the
  dataset's coordinate reference system is undefined (#1057).

New features:

- Enable setting and getting `GDAL_CACHEMAX` (#1042).
- Integer config option values are now properly encoded and decoded (#1042).
- A `from_wkt()` CRS constructor has been added (#1070).
- Targeting aligned pixels in rio-warp (#941).
- A new `WarpedVRT` class that surfaces GDAL's warp-on-demand VRT features. No
  XML editing is required (#1071, #1029).

Bug fixes:

- `dtypes.get_minimum_dtype()` now returns proper value for uint* types
  (#1064).
- Rasterio now uses `OSRRelease()` to avoid destroying shared spatial 
  reference system objects (#1031).
- GDAL_SKIP and GDAL_DRIVER_PATH options, when needed, are now set before
  driver registration (#1001).
- A failure of reprojection to an array when source dataset bands have an
  index higher than 1 has been fixed (#1056).

1.0a8 (2017-03-29)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Secrets kept in GDAL config options could have been leaked via the Python
  logger. AWS keys and tokens have always been redacted, but other options like
  GDAL_HTTP_USERPWD were not. Logging of GDAL config options has been removed.
- Use of Rasterio with Python threads has not been well tested in
  previous versions and a bug (#986) involving shared GDAL environment
  state was found. Rasterio now uses thread local variables to track
  GDAL environment state and uses the appropriate GDAL API functions to
  isolate the environments of child threads from each other while
  permitting inheritance from the main Python thread (#993, #996, #997).
  Tests using both `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `ProcessPoolExecutor` have
  been added to guard against regresion.

1.0a7 (2017-02-14)
------------------

Roses are red.
Irish say "feck."
Calling conventions
are a pain in the neck

Bug fixes:

- Use __stdcall for GDAL callbacks on Windows (#935, #951).
- Tear down Env more carefully (#968, #969), taking particular care not to
  reinstate default options when a child environment is exited.
- Always close open file handles when exiting context managers returned by
  `rasterio.open()` when file objects are given as arguments (#973).
- Properly append, not extend, shim module to extension list (#975).

1.0a6 (2017-02-03)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Order of input datasets is preserved by rio-calc (#947, #965).

New features:

- `MemoryFile()` can now take a file object parameter or bytes. The file should
  be opened in binary mode and its contents are read immediately into bytes.
  This form of argument is for convenience only; the provided file is not 
  accessed in any other way.
- A `ZipMemoryFile` class derived from `MemoryFile` has been added. It is
  created from a sequence of bytes representing a zip file. Its `open()` method
  can take a path, allowing access to files within the zip file.
- For convenience of users, Rasterio's `open()` function now takes Python file
  objects as well as filenames and URLs (#964). These file objects have their
  contents read into `MemoryFile` instances within the `open()` call, so this
  feature is equivalent to calling `MemoryFile(fp).open()`.

Refactoring:

- GDAL/OGR function definitions consolidated in gdal.pxi (#949).
- Shim APIs have been created to provide support for GDAL 2.0 and 2.1 features
  that may be absent in a system's GDAL installation.

Packaging:

- Shim API C modules are included in source distributions.

1.0a5 (2016-12-23)
------------------
- New binary wheels using version 1.2.0 of sgillies/frs-wheel-builds. See
  https://github.com/sgillies/frs-wheel-builds/blob/master/CHANGES.txt.

1.0a4 (2016-12-06)
------------------

New features:

- Geographic bounds designated by a `--geographic` option may now be
  passed to `rio clip` (#932).
- The `rio edit-info` command's new `--unset-nodata` option can be used to
  delete a dataset's nodata value (#510).

Bug fixes:

- Passing a `--co nodata=null` option to CLI commands will create
  datasets without any nodata value set. The `--co` option name follows
  GDAL's command line utilities. A `--profile` alias for this option has
  also been added.

1.0a3 (2016-10-31)
------------------

New features:

- The `DatasetBase` class is now surfaced in `rasterio.io`. This is not too
  promote the practice of subclassing `DatasetBase` but to help users that
  would like to use type annotations (#925) or make `isinstance()` assertions.
- Ground control points may be read from and written to datasets (when the
  format permits) and may be used when reprojecting arrays with `reproject()`
  or on the command line with rio-warp (#203, #916). A new rio-gcps command
  has been added, it can print a dataset's GCPs as GeoJSON Feature sequences
  or FeatureCollections.
- A `BytesIO` like `MemoryFile` class has been added for an improved Python
  interface to GDAL's in-memory filesystem (#899, #925).
- Error handlers are pushed to GDAL on entering a GDAL environment and popped
  when exiting (#876, #902, #907).
- The GIL is released when calling GDAL's ChunkAndWarp() (#912).

Bug fixes:

- transform_geom() would fail when encountering geometries with z coordinate
  values, but now handles them properly (#922, #923).
- show_hist() failed when nans were present in data (#913) and this has been
  fixed with the use of nanmin() and nanmax() in #914.


1.0a2 (2016-10-03)
------------------

New features:

- A new `mask_flag_enums` attribute has been added to dataset objects (#881).
- Support for complex data types has been enabled (#714).

Bug fixes:

- Reduce log level when trying to identify a CRS as an EPSG code (#905).
- Acquire GIL when executing the error handler (#903).
- Raster data I/O involving ndarray views has now been corrected (#900, #901).
- Support for single band index in `sample()`, which was advertised in the
  docstring but not implemented, has been added (#862).
- The rio-overview CLI command no longer opens datasets in 'r+' mode when
  listing overviews (with the `--ls` option) (#885).
- Implicit JPEG overviews for JPEG-compressed GeoTIFF files have been disabled
  in Rasterio's default environment, which means decimation is slower but
  shows fewer JPEG compression artifacts (#884).

Refactoring:

- Data type-specific functions such as `io_uint8()` have been eliminated from
  the private `_io` module and replaced by generic `io_band()`,
  `io_multi_band()`, and `io_multi_mask()` functions (#901).


1.0a1 (2016-09-15)
------------------

Documentation:

- New introduction, guidance on switching from GDAL's Python bindings and much
  more.

Breaking changes:

- The sense of rio-warp's `--bounds` options has been changed from source
  bounds to destination bounds (#549).
- Extracted Rasterio's public dataset classes into `rasterio.io` (#743).
- All Rasterio functions with will raise an exception if a GDAL style
  geotransform sequence is passed as `transform`.
- The `affine` attribute of dataset objects is deprecated.
- The `affine` member of dataset `profile` has been removed.
- The `rasterio.drivers()` context manager has been removed. It is replaced by
  `rasterio.Env()`.
- The `read_band()` method of dataset objects has been removed. It is replaced
  by `read()`.
- The `read_mask()` method of dataset objects has been removed. It is replaced
  by `read_masks()`.
- `get_data_window()`, `window_union()`, `window_intersection()`, and
  `windows_intersect()` have been removed from the `rasterio` module. They
  have been moved to `rasterio.windows`.
- The `rasterio.tool` module has been removed. Its functions have been 
  relocated to `rasterio.plot` and `rasterio.rio.insp`.
- The `rasterio.tools` module has been removed. Its functions have been
  relocated to `rasterio.mask` and `rasterio.merge`.
- The `rasterio.warp.RESAMPLING` enum has been replaced by
  `rasterio.warp.Resampling`.
- The signatures of `rasterio.features.sieve()` and
  `rasterio.features.rasterize()` have been changed: the `output` argument
  is deprecated and is replaced by `out`.
- In the CLI, the `-o` option no longer causes existing output files to be
  overwritten (#751).

New features:

- Added `descriptions` and `units` attributes to dataset objects, exposing
  the descriptions and units of dataset bands (#850, #851).
- Creation of a `Window` class to abstract Rasterio's window selection
  tuples (#759).
- Performance of `reproject()` has been increased by using an approximate
  transformer as with gdal_translate (#569).
- `Band` objects may now represent one or more dataset bands and multiband 
  reprojection of imagery kept in a GDAL dataset is now possible (#569).

Bug fixes:

- `rasterize()` now checks that the `out_shape` is 2D before continuing (#847).
- Named AWS credential profiles are now properly set up up in the main CLI
  command's environment (#838).

Refactoring:

- In the CLI, a GDAL environment is now configured by the top level command
  and then passed in a Click context to subcommands (#841).
- Removal of redundant copies of GDAL geotransform detection code (#828).
- Window methods of dataset objects have been extracted into functions of
  a new `rasterio.windows` module (#803).

Known bugs:

- `warp.project()` and rio-warp may lose one or more columns of data when 
  resampling to lower resolution (#853).

0.36.0 (2016-06-14)
-------------------

Bug fixes:

- rio-merge now copies colormaps to output files (#774, #778).
- The correct `--force-overwrite` and `--output` usage is now provided in the
  case of a `FileOverwriteError` (#750).
- Passing undefined CRS to `reproject` no longer causes a segfault (#749).
- GDAL's invert projection check is always used by default in reprojecting
  (#780).
- Forward slashes are always used for GDAL VSI paths (`/vsizip/` etc) instead
  of `os.path.sep` (#754, #789).

Documentation:

- Contributing guidelines have been added (#701).
- Axis order has been corrected in image processing doc (#700).
- A framework for comprehensive documentaton has been created (#713, #723,
  #729, #737, #738, #739, #740, #748, #756, #760).

New features:

- `--src-nodata` and `--dst-nodata` options for rio-warp (#746).
- `read()` and `read_masks()` take an `out_shape` argument for decimated reads
  (#761).
- Color interpretation of bands added to rio-info output (#766).
- Dataset objects have a new per-dataset mask property: `dataset_mask` (#716).
- Utility functions for rehaping and plotting arrays have been added to
  `rasterio.plot` (#718, #765).
- New `CRS` class like our old crs dicts, but with methods attached (#736,
  #770).

Packaging:

- setup.py has new install extras: '[plot]', and '[all]' (#744).

Refactoring:

- We've standardized on `import numpy as np` (#727, #738, #740) throughout the
  project.
- The `five` module has been renamed to `compat` (#745).

Testing:

- More coverage, more xfailing tests to mark known bugs (#742, #762, #753,
  #773, #782).

0.35.1 (2016-05-06)
-------------------

- Bug fix: restore support for URI-like GDAL dataset names such as
  'NETCDF:foo:bar' (#695).
- Bug fix: ensure GDAL environment is initialized for `transform_bounds()` as
  well as the other functions in `rasterio.warp` (#694). In implementation, we
  have done this with a function decorator.

0.35.0.post1 (2016-05-04)
-------------------------
- Bug fix: added rasterfill.cpp to MANIFEST.in so it is included in source
  distributions no matter the build system's GDAL version (#690).

0.35.0 (2016-05-04)
-------------------
- Requirements: affine requirement upped to >=1.3.0 (#430).
- Bug fix: passing an empty JSON object to `crs.from_string()` raises CRSError
  instead of passing silently (#628, #642).
- Bug fix: GDAL errors are no longer written to stderr; we no longer undefine
  error handlers (#649, #658).
- Bug fix: the Rasterio library only configures a NullHandler, applications
  must configure their own handlers to see Rasterio's log messages (#649,
  #658).
- Bug fix: AWS credentials are only sought by Rasterio when s3:// URLs are
  passed to `rasterio.open()` (#650, #665).
- Bug fix: window comparison functions now raise a ValueError when windows do
  not intersect instead of returning an empty sequence (#651, #656, #662).
- Bug fix: upgrade from deprecated Numpy usage in `read()` by explicitly
  converting window offsets to ints (#678, #680).
- Refactoring: window comparison functions may now take a variable number of
  windows as positional arguments in addition to a sequence of windows.
- Refactoring: logging is much finer grained now because we've changed to the
  `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` pattern throughout Rasterio (#649,
  #658).
- Refactoring: replaced old `drivers()` implementation with a new `Env` class
  and more consistent usage of it through the library and command line
  interface (#665, #682).

0.34.0 (2016-04-04)
-------------------
- Bug fix: S3 support was found missing in several of the CLI commands 
  mentioned below. This is corrected in 0.34 and we have the tests to prove it
  (#633).

0.33.0 (2016-04-01)
-------------------

I played a lot of One-on-One on the computers of the mid-1980s and dedicate
this release to the best #33 of all time, Larry Bird.

- Bug fix: YCbCr JPEG-in-TIFF files no longer break rio-info (#617, #618).
- New feature: the ability to read dataset metadata and imagery from S3 objects
  is an extra feature that can be installed like this `pip install -U
  rasterio[s3]`. AWS Credentials are handled by boto3 (and botocore) and so can
  be provided by environment variables, session arguments, `~/.aws/credentials`
  file, or EC2 instance metadata. S3 access is enabled in the following CLI
  commands: rio-clip, rio-info, rio-insp, rio-bounds, rio-shapes, rio-sample
  and may be expanded in future versions. S3 objects are identified on the
  command line and in API functions by URIs following the pattern
  `s3://bucket/object`. Extra thanks to Rob Emanuele and Even Rouault for
  helping on this one (#551, #610).
- New feature: new and improved documentation coming soon to a website near
  you (#588).
- Refactoring: commands for the rio CLI have been moved to their own
  modules so that they're easier to find (#594).
- Refactoring: we've changed our primary pattern for checking errors set by
  GDAL API functions (#600).

0.32.0.post1 (2016-03-27)
-------------------------
- No changes to the library in this post-release version, but there is a
  significant change to the distributions on PyPI: to help make Rasterio more
  compatible with Shapely on OS X, the GDAL shared library included in the
  macosx (only) binary wheels now statically links the GEOS library. See
  https://github.com/sgillies/frs-wheel-builds/issues/5.

0.32.0 (2016-03-22)
-------------------
- Bug fix: geometry factories and warp operations are properly deallocated
  in normal and error situations (#494, #568).
- Bug fix: a code block in rio-merge's help has been better formatted (#535).
- Bug fix: the rasterio.vfs module is imported in __init__.py to assist
  cx_Freeze (#536).
- Bug fix: old usage of `read_band()` has been replaced by `read()` throughout
  the docs (#537).
- Bug fix: accidental overwriting of existing files is now prevented by the
  `resolve_inout()` function in `rasterio.rio.helpers`. Commands that take
  one or more input files plus an output file should use this helper and force
  overwrite either by using a `--force-overwrite` option or by using the
  `-o output` option, which implicitly forces overwriting (#539, #540).
- Bug fix: missing support for NaN nodata value in rio-warp added (#542, #544).
- Bug fix: missing documentation of `rasterize()`'s `fill` parameter added
  (#543).
- Bug fix: raster dataset bounds are densified before transforming so that
  the projected output of rio-bounds is correct (#556, #557).
- Bug fix: add 'line' to the `Interleaving` enum (#560).
- Bug fix: convert `matplotlib` import errors to a `RuntimeWarning` (#562).
- Bug fix: deallocate CPL strings in error cases (#573).
- Bug fix: non-invertable affine transforms are prevented using
  `__future__.division` *#580).
- Bug fix: rio-warp clips output regions to the limits of the destination
  CRS unless disabled with `--no-check-invert-proj` (#597).
- New feature: the functionality previously available only in rio-mask is now
  available as `rasterio.tools.mask.mask()` (#552).
- New feature: raster bounds are used to label axes in `rasterio.tool.show()`
  (#553).
- New feature: GDAL's suggested warp bounds algorithm is wrapped and exposed
  for use in `warp()` and rio-warp (#574).
- Breaking change: align rio-warp's `--bounds` option with rio-merge's: these
  are in destination CRS units (#541, #545).

0.31.0 (2015-12-18)
-------------------
- Warn when rasters have no georeferencing and when the default identity
  transform will be applied by GDAL (#524, #527).
- Build OS X wheels using numpy>=1.10.2 (#529).
- When reading image windows in previous versions, given a window with
  ((row_start, row_stop), (col_start, col_stop)) if the stop index is greater
  than the width/height the start index effectively shifts as well. This can
  manifest itself in pixel misalignment if, e.g. you read block windows with
  a bit of padding to avoid edge effects. Now the window offsets are determined
  solely by row_start and col_start.(#532, #533).

0.30.0 (2015-11-16)
-------------------
- Added window utilities: get_data_window(), window_union(),
  window_intersection(), windows_intersect() (#496, #506).
- Warn when an alpha band that might provide a dataset mask is shadowed by a
  nodata attribute (#508, #523).
- IPython is not the default interpreter for rio-insp and the documentation 
  saying it is has been corrected (#518).
- Guard against creating datasets with block sizes larger than the dataset
  width and height. Such datasets are semi-broken and are likely to be 
  mangled when read (#521).
- Refactor of the `rasterio.features` tests (#522).

0.29.0 (2015-10-22)
-------------------
- Fill masked arrays in rio-calc when using Numpy 1.10.x as well as with 1.8.x
  (#500).
- When a raster dataset is not tiled, blockxsize and blockysize items are no
  longer included in its `profile` property. This prevents meaningless block
  size parameters from stripped, not tiled, datasets from being used when
  creating new datasets (#503).

0.28.0 (2015-10-06)
-------------------
- Ensure that tools module is packaged (#489, #490). The rio-merge command was
  broken in 0.27.0 and is restored to working order in version 0.28.0.
- Add `precision` keyword argument to `index()` method (#492).

0.27.0 (2015-09-25)
-------------------
- Ensure local uniqueness of the rio-shapes feature ids (#479).
- Surface compression and interleaving as dataset properties and in rio-info
  (#481). In the module, these are enums (`enums.Compression` and 
  `enums.Interleaving`); the values of the enums correspond to GDAL terms
  (i.e, "DEFLATE") and the names are what surface in the CLI ("deflate").
- Change get_window() and DatasetReader.window() to return a window guaranteed
  to cover the input bounding box (#464, #485).
- Bug fix for improperly computed transforms of output file in tools.merge and
  rio-merge (#485).
- More robust determination of dataset nodata values. In particular, the 
  absence of a nodata value is much more clear: dataset.nodata should never
  return an out of range value when there is no nodata value, it should always
  return `None` (#485).

0.26.0 (2015-08-11)
-------------------
- Add dependency on click-plugins, a new project that takes over the plugin
  duties formerly assigned to cligj (#426).
- Change rio-stack's --photometric=RGB option to --rgb (#429). Other 
  photometric interpretations should be assigned using the --co option 
  added in 0.25.0.
- Allow for ndarray-like objects (like xray arrays), not just numpy arrays,
  in warp() and elsewhere (#436).
- Add --rgb flag to rio-convert (#439).
- Fixed resampling algorithm enumeration bug (#441).
- Colormap handling was made too strict in 0.24.1 and has been made more
  forgiving. Callers are now warned when alpha values will be ignored instead
  of receiving exceptions (#444).
- Add a .gitignore (#445). Better late than never!
- Add a checksum() method to base dataset class and checksums to output of
  rio-info (#449).

0.25.0 (2015-07-17)
-------------------
- New rio-warp command (#264, #404).
- Add driver-specific creation options (`--co`) to many commands (#379, #403).
- Add support for arbitrary CRS output to rio-bounds (#385, #392).
- Add support for getting values from template files in rio-edit-info with a
  `--like` option (#387, #399).
- New rio-overview command (#388, #408).
- Fix rounding error in extracting shapes from decimated data (#391).
- Remove creation options from meta property and move them to new profile
  property (#405, #406).
- Fix for bug in passing affine keyword argument to open() in 'w' mode (#411).
- New rio-convert command (#414, #417), a replacement for gdal_translate 
  with more features to come by 1.0.
- Improved error messages when seeking a driver when none are registered 
  (#415).
- Replace read_band() with read() in the rio-insp banner (#418).
- Fix an indexing error that prevented window() and window_bounds() from 
  round-tripping properly (#419).

0.24.1 (2015-06-30)
-------------------
- Improve safety of the sample() generator (#378).
- Provide array masking features missing from Numpy<1.9 (#380, #389).
- Guard against attempts to write RGBA colormap entries to TIFFs, which the
  format can not support (#394, #395).

0.24.0 (2015-05-27)
-------------------#408).
- New rio-edit-info command (#358).
- Add option to package GDAL data in distributions (#362).
- Remove check that the path given to `rasterio.open()` in read mode is an
  existing file, turning on some non-file formats (#364).
- Addition of a `window_bounds()` method to dataset objects (#366).
- Delegation of command exiting to Click (#367).

0.23.0 (2015-05-08)
-------------------
- Redesign CLI as dynamically loaded entry points (#346).

0.22.0 (2015-05-01)
-------------------
- Return masked arrays in the boundless read case (#338).
- Add -o/--output option to rio-calc,merge,stack,mask,shapes,rasterize (#333).

0.21.0 (2015-04-22)
-------------------
- New rio-mask command (#323).
- Masking bug fix for rio-shapes (#335).
- Addition of single valued nodata property to be used instead of nodatavals
  (#329).

0.20.0 (2015-04-08)
-------------------
- Switch read() default to masked=False (#300, #317).
- Fix documentation of masking throughout module (#305).
- Remove option for in place nodata filling (#309).
- Enhancements for valid data footprint extraction in rio-shapes (#316, #318).

0.19.1 (2015-03-30)
-------------------
- Add missing blockxsize, blockysize, tiled keywords (#301).

0.19.0 (2015-03-25)
-------------------
- New rio-calc command (#175).
- Added a file band shortcut to fillnodata() (#271).
- Added fillnodata() to rio-calc functions (#277).
- New approach to masking arrays on read that conforms more closely to GDAL's
  RFC 15 (#282, #284, #285).
- New read_masks() method (#284).
- Deprecation of read_mask() and read_band (#284).

0.17.0 (2015-01-15)
-------------------
