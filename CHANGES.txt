Changes
=======

1.0.11 (2019-11-30)
-------------------

- Prevent needless warning when making boundless reads with a fill value
  (#1499).
- The GDAL band cache is flushed at the top of build_overviews to fix #1497.
- Options --gdal-data and --proj-data have been added to the rio-env command so
  that users of Rasterio wheels can get paths to set GDAL_DATA and PROJ_LIB
  environment variables.
- The attempt to make GDAL and PROJ support file discovery and configuration
  automatic within methods of the CRS class has been reverted. Users must
  execute such code inside a `with Env()` block or set the GDAL_DATA and
  PROJ_LIB environment variables needed by GDAL.

1.0.10 (2019-11-16)
-------------------

- Avoid segmentation fault when OSRGetAuthority* functions return null
  pointers, making Rasterio more robust when reading CRS that don't map
  perfectly to PROJ.
- Ensure that GDAL and PROJ support files can be found in Rasterio wheels when
  we call CRS methods (#1539).
- Accomodate the Esri flavor of projection WKT (#1537).
- Add missing raster offsets and scales properties (#1527).

1.0.9 (2019-10-25)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Delegate test of the environment for existing session credentials to the
  session class to generalize credentialization of GDAL to cloud providers
  other than AWS (#1520). The env.hascreds function is no longer used in
  Rasterio and has been marked as deprecated.
- Switch to use of botocore Credentials.get_frozen_credentials (#1521).
- Numpy masked arrays with the normal Numpy mask sense (True == invalid) are
  now supported as input for feature.shapes(). The mask keyword argument of the
  function keeps to the GDAL sense of masks (nonzero == invalid) and the
  documentation has been improved to communicate this (#1517).
- The defaults for WarpedVRT's `src_nodata` and `nodata` keyword arguments are
  no longer None, but are markers for the default behavior: inheritance of
  nodata values from the VRT's source dataset. Values of `None` for these
  keyword arguments means that the VRT does not inherit from the source and has
  no nodata value at all (#1503).
- WEBP has been added to the Compression enum. Exploitation of this new
  compression mode will require GDAL 2.4.
- Rasterio now check for two AWS environment variables before creating a
  session (#1494).
- The ensure_env_with_credentials decorator which wraps rasterio.open will no
  longer clobber the credentials in a surrounding environment or seek
  credentials when they already exist (#1507).
- The comparison of CRS objects to dicts and strs that we pledged to remove at
  1.0 has at last been removed (#1492).

1.0.8 (2018-10-02)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Datasets contained in MemoryFile buffers are now opened in r+ or w+ mode
  instead of r or w.
- The namedtuple _asdict method is overridden in BoundingBox to work around a
  bug in Python 3.4.3 (#1486, #1488). This unblocks creation of manylinux1
  wheels for Python 3.4.

1.0.7 (2018-09-26)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Use the non-resolving path form of files_inout_arg in rio-convert and
  rio-shapes (#999).
- Filling the empty regions of boundless reads was too slow in some cases and
  a faster solution has been found (#1480).
- Require cligj>=0.5 for compatibility with click 7.0.
- Precisely specify CLI option and argument names for click 6.x and 7.0
  compatibility.

1.0.6 (2018-09-24)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- If the build_overviews method of a dataset is passed a list of factors that
  specify more than one 1x1 pixel overview (#1333), Rasterio raises an
  exception.
- Calling calculate_default_transform for large extents should no longer result
  in the out of memory error reported in #1131. The rio-warp command should
  also now run more quickly and with a smaller memory footprint.
- We have a more general fix for the problem of filling the empty regions of
  boundless reads (#1471).

1.0.5 (2018-09-19)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- The fill value for boundless reads was ignored in Rasterio versions 1-1.0.4
  but now applies (#1471).
- An invalid shortcut has been eliminated and Rasterio now produces a proper
  mask in the boundless masked read case (#1449).
- Loss of a row or column in geometry_window() and mask() has been fixed
  (#1472).

1.0.4 (2018-09-17)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Boundless reads of datasets without a coordinate reference system have been
  fixed (#1448).
- A y-directional error in disjoint_bounds (#1459) has been fixed.
- Prevent geometries from being thrown near projection singularities (#1446).
- Missing --aws-no-sign-requests and --aws-requester-pays options added to
  the main rio command (#1460).
- Add missing bilinear, cubic spline, lanczos resampling modes for overviews
  (#1457).
- Raise ValueError if get_writer_for_driver() is called without a driver
  name.
- Windows are now frozen so that they are hashable (#1452).

Refactoring:

- Use of InMemoryRaster eliminates redundant code in the _warp module (#1427,
  #816).
- Generalize sessions to support cloud providers other than AWS (#1429).

1.0.3.post1 (2018-09-07)
------------------------

This version corrects errors made in building binary wheels for 1.0.3. There
are no bug fixes or new features in this version.

1.0.3 (2018-08-01)

Bug fixes:

- A regression in GeoJSON source handling in rio-rasterize (#1425) has been
  fixed.
- Rasterization of linear rings (#1431) is now supported.
- The input file handler of rio-rasterize has been changed so that it does not
  reject GeoJSON files (#1425).
- Linear rings have been added as acceptable input for rio-rasterize and other
  commands and functions (#1431).

1.0.2 (2018-07-27)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- The output of calculate_default_transform() can be fixed to output dimensions
  as well as to output resolution (#1409).
- In using rio-warp, the --src-bounds option can now override the bounds of the
  source dataset when --dimensions is used (#1419).
- Bounds of rotated rasters are now calculated correctly (#1422).
- A band indexing bug in reproject() (#1350) has been fixed (#1424).

1.0.1 (2018-07-23)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Bounding envelopes are densified at higher precision in transform_bounds to
  fix #1411.
- Add LERC compression to enums.Compression (#1412).
- The reproject() function now passes dst_alpha properly to _reproject(), which
  unlocks materialization of warp destination alpha band masks (#1417).
- The --dimensions and --src-bounds options of rio-warp can be used together
  as expected (#1418).

1.0.0 (2018-07-12)
------------------

There have been no changes since release candidate 5.

1.0rc5 (2018-07-09)
-------------------

- C source files are now generated using Cython 0.28.3, which gives us support
  for Python 3.7 (#1404, #1405).

1.0rc4 (2018-07-05)
-------------------

- An integer overflow when multiplying the warp memory limit (#1401) has been
  fixed.

1.0rc3 (2018-07-03)
-------------------

- CRS based EPSG codes can now report that code using a new `to_epsg()` method
  (#1288).
- A regression in rasterio.warp.reproject has been reported (#1395), confirmed,
  and fixed.

1.0rc2 (2018-06-29)
-------------------

Deprecation:

- The rasterio.vfs module has been removed.
- Reading array data or masks from datasets opened in "w" mode is prohibited.
- Property set_* methods of datasets have been removed. The appropriate
  properties should be used instead. For example, ``dataset.crs = "EPSG:4326"``
  instead of ``dataset.set_crs("EPSG:4326")``.
- Rasterio ignores creation options saved in the metadata of datasets
  by Rasterio versions < 1.0b1.

1.0rc1 (2018-06-27)
-------------------

Bug fixes:

- Internal Env() in `rasterio.open` has been replaced with an environment
  ensuring decorator (#1009). The same decorator ensures that credentials are
  obtained when functions from `rasterio.shutils` are called.
- Input file arguments for all CLI commands are now parsed and validated in
  a uniform manner (#999).
- Local loggers have all been changed to `getLogger(__name__)` in rasterio.rio
  module (#1328).

1.0b4 (2018-06-23)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- We now raise an exception when WarpedVRT is asked to add an alpha band and
  one already exists for the VRT.

1.0b3 (2018-06-21)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- The warp memory limit configuration available in gdalwarp has been added
  to `reproject()` and `WarpedVRT`.
- Avoid boundless reads when sampling pixels outside a dataset's extent
  (#1249).
- The logic behind rio-warp's --target-aligned-pixels has been factored into
  a new `aligned_target()` function in the warp module to help resolve 
  #853.
- A regression in the VSI path of some zip:// URLs has been fixed (#1377).
- Transform, coordinate reference system, and ground control points are
  properly set when opening a dataset in w+ mode (#1359.

1.0b2 (2018-06-19)
------------------

Breaking changes:

- `boundless=True` reads from warped VRTs are disallowed. Instead, VRTs should
  be constructed so that only data bounded by their extents is read. In
  exchange, boundless reads for non-VRT datasets are faster and more robust.

Upcoming deprecations:

- Comparison of CRS objects to str or dict is deprecated.

New features:

- Added `out`, `out_shape`, `window`, `resampling` keyword parameters to
  the `dataset_mask` method (#1298).
- CRS.from_string can now take WKT strings as input.

Bug fixes:

- Tests have been added to confirm that reading from a WarpedVRT will use the
  source dataset's masks and overviews.
- Expectations of warp tests that use resampling algorithms other than nearest
  neighbor have been corrected.
- WarpedVRT.crs now returns a CRS, not a str.
- A Windows-crashing bug in the _warp module has been fixed (#1356).

1.0b1 (2018-05-25)
------------------

Breaking changes:

- The signatures of all Dataset constructors have changed: these method now
  take instance of ParsedPath or UnparsedPath from rasterio.path and do not
  take strings.
- The signatures of get_writer_for_path and get_writer_for_driver have 
  changed in the same way.
- Whether to print GeoJSON feature sequences or a GeoJSON feature collection
  from rio-shapes is now controlled by a ``--sequence/--collection`` option.
  A sequence is now the default (#927).
- Comparing empty ``CRS`` objects returns ``True`` (#1034).
- Deprecated window functions have been removed from the rasterio module. Their
  replacements are in rasterio.windows (#1115).
- The deprecated r- mode has been removed from ``rasterio.open()`` (#1116).
- A bytearray is no longer allowed as input to the ``MemoryFile`` constructor.
  Users must convert byte arrays to ``bytes before calling ``MemoryFile()``.
- Signatures of private functions and classes in _features, _warp, _io have
  been changed to always take instances of Affine instead of GDAL geotransform
  arrays (#796).
- Calling `rasterio.Env()` no longer sets hidden default config options
  CHECK_WITH_INVERT_PROJ=True and GTIFF_IMPLICIT_JPEG_OVR=False (#1011).
- Rasterio no longer saves creation options in metadata on created datasets
  (#1332).

A number of deprecated features have been removed (#1319).

- In the rasterio.open function: we have removed 'affine' as an alias for
  'transform'.
- In the _base.DatasetBase class, and thereby all dataset objects: we have
  removed the mask_flags and affine properties. Instead, users must use the
  mask_flag_enums and transform properties.
- In the _io.DatasetReaderBase class, and thereby all dataset objects: we have
  removed the read_mask method. Users must use the read_masks method.
- In the features.rasterize function: we have removed 'replace' and 'add' as
  aliases for ``MergeAlg.replace`` and ``MergeAlg.add``.
- In the profiles.Profile class: we have removed 'affine' as alias for
  'transform' and have removed the `__call__` method. The class is no longer
  callable. Users must use the mapping protocol to copy and update profiles.
- In the windows.WindowMethodsMixin class, and thereby all dataset objects: we
  have removed the 'boundless' keyword arg from the window and from_bounds
  methods.
- In the windows.Window class: we have removed the num_cols and num_rows
  properties, the __getitem__ method, and the from_offlen and from_ranges class
  methods.

Upcoming deprecation:

- The rasterio.vfs module and its functions are being replaced by new functions
  in rasterio.path.
- Reading array data or masks from datasets opened in "w" mode will be
  prohibited in Rasterio 1.0. We are warning about this now (#1309).
- Property set_* methods of datasets will be deprecated in 1.0. The appropriate
  properties should be used instead. For example,
  ``dataset.crs = "EPSG:4326"`` instead of ``dataset.set_crs("EPSG:4326")``.
- Rasterio 1.0 will ignore creation options saved in the metadata of datasets
  by Rasterio versions < 1.0b1. Users can opt in to this behavior now by
  setting RIO_IGNORE_CREATION_KWDS=TRUE in their environments.

New features:

- New ParsedPath and UnparsedPath classes have been added to improve input
  file handling and validation. The existing parse_path and vsi_path functions
  have been rewritten to use these new classes and have been moved to the new
  rasterio.path module. The signature of rasterio.open has not been changed
  and users of Rasterio will be unaffected.
- set_band_unit and set_band_description methods have been added to
  dataset writers/updaters to support rio-edit-info (#1344).
- A tools module has been added to collect file-based functions and supporting
  classes (#1300).
- ``rasterio.features.dataset_features()`` has been extracted from
  rio-shapes (#1282, #1286).

Bug fixes:

- The block_shapes and files properties of datasets now return lists instead
  of tuples.
- The ``--nodata`` option of rio-merge is now passed to the output file
  (#1345).
- The precision keyword arguments for methods in the windows and transform
  modules now default to None, which means no rounding of values by
  default (#1139).
- The pixel_precision keyword arguments for methods in the windows module now
  default to None (#1143).
- Rasterio functions and methods, even the private ones, now always take
  instances of Affine as transform parameters (#796).
- Importing the features, fill, io, and warp modules would set the
  CHECK_WITH_INVERT_PROJ=True and GTIFF_IMPLICIT_JPEG_OVR=False config options
  in a hidden way. This has been fixed in #1340.
- Add Debian data directory to set of well-known paths to search (#1337).
- Pass precision parameter from ``merge`` to ``from_bounds`` (#1307).
- Added the missing w+ mode (#1309).
- Rotated datasets are now masked properly (#1240, #1278).
- Geometry collections are flattened in ``rasterize`` to work around
  incidental holes created by GDAL (#1253, #1274).
- Add missing support for Python geo protocol in features module (#1268,
  (#1269).
- ``mask()`` now takes the ``indexes`` keyword parameter that is common
  elsewhere in the package (#1224, #1225).
- Sharing of dataset handles may be disabled for multithreaded applications
  using the new `sharing` keyword argument of `rasterio.open` (#1260).
- ``WarpedVRT()`` properly sets a CRS on the internal VRT handle when
  that VRT is produced by ``GDALCreateVRT()`` (#1283).

1.0a12 (2017-12-01)
-------------------

New features:

- ``rasterio.open()`` now accepts URLs with GET parameters (#1121).
- Specific drivers and options can be used in ``rasterio.open()`` (#1000,
  #1158, #1196).
- ``rasterize()`` now supports GDAL's 'add' algorithm (#1195).
- GDAL version checking has been consolidated and improved (#1210).

Bug fixes:

- Pad boundless read VRTs so we don't overflow due to rounding (#1184).
- Boundless reads of WarpedVRTs are enabled by setting an effective crs
  (#1188).
- Raise ValueError when invalid width/height are passed to the
  ``InMemoryRaster`` constructor (#1144, #1194).
- GDAL errors that are turned into Rasterio exceptions are no longer also sent
  automatically to the logger. They may, of course, be logged by user code.
- Raster width and height were swapped in ``geometry_window()`` (#1200).

1.0a11 (2017-10-30)
-------------------

Breaking changes:

- ``rasterio.copy()`` moved to ``rasterio.shutil.copy() (#1173).
- ``DatasetBase.colorinterp`` is now a setter/getter that operates on
  a sequence of ``ColorInterp.<enum>`` in band order (#1134).

New features:

- Addition of ``rasterio.shutil.delete()`` and ``$ rio rm`` for deleting
  datasets (#929).
- Addition of ``rasterio.shutil.exists()`` for determining if a dataset
  exists (#1173).
- Addition of ``rasterio.shutil.copyfiles()`` to copy files associated
  with a datset from one location to another (#1173).
- Allow setting band color interpretation in a ``set_colorinterp()`` method
  and in ``$ rio edit-info --colorinterp`` (#1133).

Bug fixes:

- Reprojection of numpy arrays using GCPs has never worked due to faulty code,
  but has been fixed (#1166, #1171).
- A circular import situation has been resolved by moving dataset mixin classes
  from ``rasterio.io`` to ``rasterio.windows`` and ``rasterio.transform``
  (#1174, #1173).
- Prevent a segmentation fault in ``rasterio.features.rasterize()`` by guarding
  against unsupported GeoJSON input (#1172, #1176).

1.0a10 (2017-10-09)
-------------------

Breaking changes:

- In the GeoJSON output of rio-blocks, the windows are now JSON
  representations of the ``Window`` class (#1074).
- The ``rasterio.windows.Window`` class no longer derives from ``tuple``.
  Comparisons like ``Window(0, 0, 1, 1) == ((0, 1), (0, 1))`` are no
  longer possible. Instead, call the ``.toranges()`` method of the 
  former or coerce the latter using ``Window.from_ranges`` (#1074).
- The ``rasterio.windows.from_bounds`` function now always returns unbounded,
  meaning uncropped, Windows. For example, if given a bounding box entirely
  to the west and north of the geotransform's origin, the result will be a 
  Window entirely to the left and above the dataset's row and column origin.
  Passing a ``boundless`` keyword argument to this function will result in a 
  warning.
- The ``TransformMethodsMixin.ul`` method, deprecated since 0.36, has been
  removed (#1100).

New features:

- Float precision read/write windows are now supported throughout
  Rasterio (#1074).
- Use of old style range tuples as windows is deprecated and warned
  against (#1074).
- Addition of dataset ``block()`` method (#1077).
- Added access to subdatasets, both in the API and CLI (see `rio info
  --subdatasets`) (#1127).


Bug fixes:

- We always reacquire the GIL when GDAL calls the rasterio logging error
  handler (#1103, #1104).
- Initialization of an unneeded array, sometimes contributing to memory
  exhaustion, has been eliminated (#1131, #1132).
- Rasterio's boundless reading has had a compositing bug. We are resolving
  it by using a VRT internally and relying upon the VRT's windowing and
  compositing logic (#1161).
- AWS credentials set in an ``Env`` are no longer clobbered by credentials
  from a default boto3 session inside ``rasterio.open`` (#1075).
- NaN can now be used as a nodata value in ``merge`` and when setting nodata
  from `rio edit-info` (#1160).

1.0a9 (2017-06-02)
------------------

Breaking changes:

- Removed `**options` argument from `rasterio.warp.transform()`.  Transformer
  options should be set explicitly inside the currently active
  `rasterio.env.Env()`(#1010).  This argument was initially added in `1.0a1`.
- The function `transform_geom()` now always splits geometries at the anti-
  meridian (#1024).
- The `crs` property of a dataset is now `None` instead of `CRS()` when the
  dataset's coordinate reference system is undefined (#1057).

New features:

- Enable setting and getting `GDAL_CACHEMAX` (#1042).
- Integer config option values are now properly encoded and decoded (#1042).
- A `from_wkt()` CRS constructor has been added (#1070).
- Targeting aligned pixels in rio-warp (#941).
- A new `WarpedVRT` class that surfaces GDAL's warp-on-demand VRT features. No
  XML editing is required (#1071, #1029).

Bug fixes:

- `dtypes.get_minimum_dtype()` now returns proper value for uint* types
  (#1064).
- Rasterio now uses `OSRRelease()` to avoid destroying shared spatial 
  reference system objects (#1031).
- GDAL_SKIP and GDAL_DRIVER_PATH options, when needed, are now set before
  driver registration (#1001).
- A failure of reprojection to an array when source dataset bands have an
  index higher than 1 has been fixed (#1056).

1.0a8 (2017-03-29)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Secrets kept in GDAL config options could have been leaked via the Python
  logger. AWS keys and tokens have always been redacted, but other options like
  GDAL_HTTP_USERPWD were not. Logging of GDAL config options has been removed.
- Use of Rasterio with Python threads has not been well tested in
  previous versions and a bug (#986) involving shared GDAL environment
  state was found. Rasterio now uses thread local variables to track
  GDAL environment state and uses the appropriate GDAL API functions to
  isolate the environments of child threads from each other while
  permitting inheritance from the main Python thread (#993, #996, #997).
  Tests using both `ThreadPoolExecutor` and `ProcessPoolExecutor` have
  been added to guard against regresion.

1.0a7 (2017-02-14)
------------------

Roses are red.
Irish say "feck."
Calling conventions
are a pain in the neck

Bug fixes:

- Use __stdcall for GDAL callbacks on Windows (#935, #951).
- Tear down Env more carefully (#968, #969), taking particular care not to
  reinstate default options when a child environment is exited.
- Always close open file handles when exiting context managers returned by
  `rasterio.open()` when file objects are given as arguments (#973).
- Properly append, not extend, shim module to extension list (#975).

1.0a6 (2017-02-03)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Order of input datasets is preserved by rio-calc (#947, #965).

New features:

- `MemoryFile()` can now take a file object parameter or bytes. The file should
  be opened in binary mode and its contents are read immediately into bytes.
  This form of argument is for convenience only; the provided file is not 
  accessed in any other way.
- A `ZipMemoryFile` class derived from `MemoryFile` has been added. It is
  created from a sequence of bytes representing a zip file. Its `open()` method
  can take a path, allowing access to files within the zip file.
- For convenience of users, Rasterio's `open()` function now takes Python file
  objects as well as filenames and URLs (#964). These file objects have their
  contents read into `MemoryFile` instances within the `open()` call, so this
  feature is equivalent to calling `MemoryFile(fp).open()`.

Refactoring:

- GDAL/OGR function definitions consolidated in gdal.pxi (#949).
- Shim APIs have been created to provide support for GDAL 2.0 and 2.1 features
  that may be absent in a system's GDAL installation.

Packaging:

- Shim API C modules are included in source distributions.

1.0a5 (2016-12-23)
------------------
- New binary wheels using version 1.2.0 of sgillies/frs-wheel-builds. See
  https://github.com/sgillies/frs-wheel-builds/blob/master/CHANGES.txt.

1.0a4 (2016-12-06)
------------------

New features:

- Geographic bounds designated by a `--geographic` option may now be
  passed to `rio clip` (#932).
- The `rio edit-info` command's new `--unset-nodata` option can be used to
  delete a dataset's nodata value (#510).

Bug fixes:

- Passing a `--co nodata=null` option to CLI commands will create
  datasets without any nodata value set. The `--co` option name follows
  GDAL's command line utilities. A `--profile` alias for this option has
  also been added.

1.0a3 (2016-10-31)
------------------

New features:

- The `DatasetBase` class is now surfaced in `rasterio.io`. This is not too
  promote the practice of subclassing `DatasetBase` but to help users that
  would like to use type annotations (#925) or make `isinstance()` assertions.
- Ground control points may be read from and written to datasets (when the
  format permits) and may be used when reprojecting arrays with `reproject()`
  or on the command line with rio-warp (#203, #916). A new rio-gcps command
  has been added, it can print a dataset's GCPs as GeoJSON Feature sequences
  or FeatureCollections.
- A `BytesIO` like `MemoryFile` class has been added for an improved Python
  interface to GDAL's in-memory filesystem (#899, #925).
- Error handlers are pushed to GDAL on entering a GDAL environment and popped
  when exiting (#876, #902, #907).
- The GIL is released when calling GDAL's ChunkAndWarp() (#912).

Bug fixes:

- transform_geom() would fail when encountering geometries with z coordinate
  values, but now handles them properly (#922, #923).
- show_hist() failed when nans were present in data (#913) and this has been
  fixed with the use of nanmin() and nanmax() in #914.


1.0a2 (2016-10-03)
------------------

New features:

- A new `mask_flag_enums` attribute has been added to dataset objects (#881).
- Support for complex data types has been enabled (#714).

Bug fixes:

- Reduce log level when trying to identify a CRS as an EPSG code (#905).
- Acquire GIL when executing the error handler (#903).
- Raster data I/O involving ndarray views has now been corrected (#900, #901).
- Support for single band index in `sample()`, which was advertised in the
  docstring but not implemented, has been added (#862).
- The rio-overview CLI command no longer opens datasets in 'r+' mode when
  listing overviews (with the `--ls` option) (#885).
- Implicit JPEG overviews for JPEG-compressed GeoTIFF files have been disabled
  in Rasterio's default environment, which means decimation is slower but
  shows fewer JPEG compression artifacts (#884).

Refactoring:

- Data type-specific functions such as `io_uint8()` have been eliminated from
  the private `_io` module and replaced by generic `io_band()`,
  `io_multi_band()`, and `io_multi_mask()` functions (#901).


1.0a1 (2016-09-15)
------------------

Documentation:

- New introduction, guidance on switching from GDAL's Python bindings and much
  more.

Breaking changes:

- The sense of rio-warp's `--bounds` options has been changed from source
  bounds to destination bounds (#549).
- Extracted Rasterio's public dataset classes into `rasterio.io` (#743).

  is deprecated and is replaced by `out`.
- In the CLI, the `-o` option no longer causes existing output files to be
  overwritten (#751).

New features:

- Added `descriptions` and `units` attributes to dataset objects, exposing
  the descriptions and units of dataset bands (#850, #851).
- Creation of a `Window` class to abstract Rasterio's window selection
  tuples (#759).

  reprojection of imagery kept in a GDAL dataset is now possible (#569).

Bug fixes:

- `rasterize()` now checks that the `out_shape` is 2D before continuing (#847).
- Named AWS credential profiles are now properly set up up in the main CLI
  command's environment (#838).

Refactoring:

- In the CLI, a GDAL environment is now configured by the top level command
  and then passed in a Click context to subcommands (#841).
- Removal of redundant copies of GDAL geotransform detection code (#828).
- Window methods of dataset objects have been extracted into functions of
  a new `rasterio.windows` module (#803).

Known bugs:

- `warp.project()` and rio-warp may lose one or more columns of data when 
  resampling to lower resolution (#853).

0.36.0 (2016-06-14)
-------------------

Bug fixes:

- rio-merge now copies colormaps to output files (#774, #778).
- The correct `--force-overwrite` and `--output` usage is now provided in the
  case of a `FileOverwriteError` (#750).
- Passing undefined CRS to `reproject` no longer causes a segfault (#749).
- GDAL's invert projection check is always used by default in reprojecting
  (#780).
- Forward slashes are always used for GDAL VSI paths (`/vsizip/` etc) instead
  of `os.path.sep` (#754, #789).

Documentation:

- Contributing guidelines have been added (#701).
- Axis order has been corrected in image processing doc (#700).
- A framework for comprehensive documentaton has been created (#713, #723,
  #729, #737, #738, #739, #740, #748, #756, #760).

New features:

- `--src-nodata` and `--dst-nodata` options for rio-warp (#746).
- `read()` and `read_masks()` take an `out_shape` argument for decimated reads
  (#761).
- Color interpretation of bands added to rio-info output (#766).
- Dataset objects have a new per-dataset mask property: `dataset_mask` (#716).
- Utility functions for rehaping and plotting arrays have been added to
  `rasterio.plot` (#718, #765).
- New `CRS` class like our old crs dicts, but with methods attached (#736,
  #770).

Packaging:

- setup.py has new install extras: '[plot]', and '[all]' (#744).

Refactoring:

- We've standardized on `import numpy as np` (#727, #738, #740) throughout the
  project.
- The `five` module has been renamed to `compat` (#745).

Testing:

- More coverage, more xfailing tests to mark known bugs (#742, #762, #753,
  #773, #782).

0.35.1 (2016-05-06)
-------------------

- Bug fix: restore support for URI-like GDAL dataset names such as
  'NETCDF:foo:bar' (#695).
- Bug fix: ensure GDAL environment is initialized for `transform_bounds()` as
  well as the other functions in `rasterio.warp` (#694). In implementation, we
  have done this with a function decorator.

0.35.0.post1 (2016-05-04)
-------------------------
- Bug fix: added rasterfill.cpp to MANIFEST.in so it is included in source
  distributions no matter the build system's GDAL version (#690).

0.35.0 (2016-05-04)
-------------------
- Requirements: affine requirement upped to >=1.3.0 (#430).
- Bug fix: passing an empty JSON object to `crs.from_string()` raises CRSError
  instead of passing silently (#628, #642).
- Bug fix: GDAL errors are no longer written to stderr; we no longer undefine
  error handlers (#649, #658).
- Bug fix: the Rasterio library only configures a NullHandler, applications
  must configure their own handlers to see Rasterio's log messages (#649,
  #658).
- Bug fix: AWS credentials are only sought by Rasterio when s3:// URLs are
  passed to `rasterio.open()` (#650, #665).
- Bug fix: window comparison functions now raise a ValueError when windows do
  not intersect instead of returning an empty sequence (#651, #656, #662).
- Bug fix: upgrade from deprecated Numpy usage in `read()` by explicitly
  converting window offsets to ints (#678, #680).
- Refactoring: window comparison functions may now take a variable number of
  windows as positional arguments in addition to a sequence of windows.
- Refactoring: logging is much finer grained now because we've changed to the
  `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` pattern throughout Rasterio (#649,
  #658).
- Refactoring: replaced old `drivers()` implementation with a new `Env` class
  and more consistent usage of it through the library and command line
  interface (#665, #682).

0.34.0 (2016-04-04)
-------------------
- Bug fix: S3 support was found missing in several of the CLI commands 
  mentioned below. This is corrected in 0.34 and we have the tests to prove it
  (#633).

0.33.0 (2016-04-01)
-------------------

I played a lot of One-on-One on the computers of the mid-1980s and dedicate
this release to the best #33 of all time, Larry Bird.

- Bug fix: YCbCr JPEG-in-TIFF files no longer break rio-info (#617, #618).
- New feature: the ability to read dataset metadata and imagery from S3 objects
  is an extra feature that can be installed like this `pip install -U
  rasterio[s3]`. AWS Credentials are handled by boto3 (and botocore) and so can
  be provided by environment variables, session arguments, `~/.aws/credentials`
  file, or EC2 instance metadata. S3 access is enabled in the following CLI
  commands: rio-clip, rio-info, rio-insp, rio-bounds, rio-shapes, rio-sample
  and may be expanded in future versions. S3 objects are identified on the
  command line and in API functions by URIs following the pattern
  `s3://bucket/object`. Extra thanks to Rob Emanuele and Even Rouault for
  helping on this one (#551, #610).
- New feature: new and improved documentation coming soon to a website near
  you (#588).
- Refactoring: commands for the rio CLI have been moved to their own
  modules so that they're easier to find (#594).
- Refactoring: we've changed our primary pattern for checking errors set by
  GDAL API functions (#600).

0.32.0.post1 (2016-03-27)
-------------------------
- No changes to the library in this post-release version, but there is a
  significant change to the distributions on PyPI: to help make Rasterio more
  compatible with Shapely on OS X, the GDAL shared library included in the
  macosx (only) binary wheels now statically links the GEOS library. See
  https://github.com/sgillies/frs-wheel-builds/issues/5.

0.32.0 (2016-03-22)
-------------------
- Bug fix: geometry factories and warp operations are properly deallocated
  in normal and error situations (#494, #568).
- Bug fix: a code block in rio-merge's help has been better formatted (#535).
- Bug fix: the rasterio.vfs module is imported in __init__.py to assist
  cx_Freeze (#536).
- Bug fix: old usage of `read_band()` has been replaced by `read()` throughout
  the docs (#537).
- Bug fix: accidental overwriting of existing files is now prevented by the
  `resolve_inout()` function in `rasterio.rio.helpers`. Commands that take
  one or more input files plus an output file should use this helper and force
  overwrite either by using a `--force-overwrite` option or by using the
  `-o output` option, which implicitly forces overwriting (#539, #540).
- Bug fix: missing support for NaN nodata value in rio-warp added (#542, #544).
- Bug fix: missing documentation of `rasterize()`'s `fill` parameter added
  (#543).
- Bug fix: raster dataset bounds are densified before transforming so that
  the projected output of rio-bounds is correct (#556, #557).
- Bug fix: add 'line' to the `Interleaving` enum (#560).
- Bug fix: convert `matplotlib` import errors to a `RuntimeWarning` (#562).
- Bug fix: deallocate CPL strings in error cases (#573).
- Bug fix: non-invertable affine transforms are prevented using
  `__future__.division` *#580).
- Bug fix: rio-warp clips output regions to the limits of the destination
  CRS unless disabled with `--no-check-invert-proj` (#597).
- New feature: the functionality previously available only in rio-mask is now
  available as `rasterio.tools.mask.mask()` (#552).
- New feature: raster bounds are used to label axes in `rasterio.tool.show()`
  (#553).
- New feature: GDAL's suggested warp bounds algorithm is wrapped and exposed
  for use in `warp()` and rio-warp (#574).
- Breaking change: align rio-warp's `--bounds` option with rio-merge's: these
  are in destination CRS units (#541, #545).

0.31.0 (2015-12-18)
-------------------
- Warn when rasters have no georeferencing and when the default identity
  transform will be applied by GDAL (#524, #527).
- Build OS X wheels using numpy>=1.10.2 (#529).
- When reading image windows in previous versions, given a window with
  ((row_start, row_stop), (col_start, col_stop)) if the stop index is greater
  than the width/height the start index effectively shifts as well. This can
  manifest itself in pixel misalignment if, e.g. you read block windows with
  a bit of padding to avoid edge effects. Now the window offsets are determined
  solely by row_start and col_start.(#532, #533).

0.30.0 (2015-11-16)
-------------------
- Added window utilities: get_data_window(), window_union(),
  window_intersection(), windows_intersect() (#496, #506).
- Warn when an alpha band that might provide a dataset mask is shadowed by a
  nodata attribute (#508, #523).
- IPython is not the default interpreter for rio-insp and the documentation 
  saying it is has been corrected (#518).
- Guard against creating datasets with block sizes larger than the dataset
  width and height. Such datasets are semi-broken and are likely to be 
  mangled when read (#521).
- Refactor of the `rasterio.features` tests (#522).

0.29.0 (2015-10-22)
-------------------
- Fill masked arrays in rio-calc when using Numpy 1.10.x as well as with 1.8.x
  (#500).
- When a raster dataset is not tiled, blockxsize and blockysize items are no
  longer included in its `profile` property. This prevents meaningless block
  size parameters from stripped, not tiled, datasets from being used when
  creating new datasets (#503).

0.28.0 (2015-10-06)
-------------------
- Ensure that tools module is packaged (#489, #490). The rio-merge command was
  broken in 0.27.0 and is restored to working order in version 0.28.0.
- Add `precision` keyword argument to `index()` method (#492).

0.27.0 (2015-09-25)
-------------------
- Ensure local uniqueness of the rio-shapes feature ids (#479).
- Surface compression and interleaving as dataset properties and in rio-info
  (#481). In the module, these are enums (`enums.Compression` and 
  `enums.Interleaving`); the values of the enums correspond to GDAL terms
  (i.e, "DEFLATE") and the names are what surface in the CLI ("deflate").
- Change get_window() and DatasetReader.window() to return a window guaranteed
  to cover the input bounding box (#464, #485).
- Bug fix for improperly computed transforms of output file in tools.merge and
  rio-merge (#485).
- More robust determination of dataset nodata values. In particular, the 
  absence of a nodata value is much more clear: dataset.nodata should never
  return an out of range value when there is no nodata value, it should always
  return `None` (#485).

0.26.0 (2015-08-11)
-------------------
- Add dependency on click-plugins, a new project that takes over the plugin
  duties formerly assigned to cligj (#426).
- Change rio-stack's --photometric=RGB option to --rgb (#429). Other 
  photometric interpretations should be assigned using the --co option 
  added in 0.25.0.
- Allow for ndarray-like objects (like xray arrays), not just numpy arrays,
  in warp() and elsewhere (#436).
- Add --rgb flag to rio-convert (#439).
- Fixed resampling algorithm enumeration bug (#441).
- Colormap handling was made too strict in 0.24.1 and has been made more
  forgiving. Callers are now warned when alpha values will be ignored instead
  of receiving exceptions (#444).
- Add a .gitignore (#445). Better late than never!
- Add a checksum() method to base dataset class and checksums to output of
  rio-info (#449).

0.25.0 (2015-07-17)
-------------------
- New rio-warp command (#264, #404).
- Add driver-specific creation options (`--co`) to many commands (#379, #403).

- New rio-convert command (#414, #417), a replacement for gdal_translate 
  with more features to come by 1.0.
- Improved error messages when seeking a driver when none are registered 
  (#415).
- Replace read_band() with read() in the rio-insp banner (#418).
- Fix an indexing error that prevented window() and window_bounds() from 
  round-tripping properly (#419).

0.24.1 (2015-06-30)
-------------------
- Improve safety of the sample() generator (#378).
- Provide array masking features missing from Numpy<1.9 (#380, #389).
- Guard against attempts to write RGBA colormap entries to TIFFs, which the
  format can not support (#394, #395).

-------------------#408).
- New rio-edit-info command (#358).
